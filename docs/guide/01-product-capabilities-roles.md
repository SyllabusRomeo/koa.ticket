## 1. What LogIt is

LogIt is a **self-hosted enterprise IT Service Management (ITSM)** platform. It is not a bare ticket form — it is an operating system for IT work:

- Capture demand from **web, email, Slack, Teams, chat, and API**
- Route and prioritize work with **skills, teams, locations, and SLA**
- Collaborate with **comments, internal notes, watchers, work logs, and presence**
- Manage **incidents, requests, access, problems, changes (CAB), and major incidents**
- Publish **knowledge** and a **service catalog** with dynamic forms
- Track **assets / CMDB** relationships and impact
- Prove control with **approvals, audit (incl. checksummed export schedules), and reports**

**Brand:** primary `#0F4A40`, light `#EDF4AC`, secondary `#456433`, warm `#FBF1DA`.

**Principle of the product roadmap:** *Capture data → workflows → real-time → analytics → automation → AI.*

## 3. Personas, roles & permissions

### Personas

| Persona | Job in LogIt |
| --- | --- |
| Employee / requester | Create & track own tickets; catalog; knowledge |
| IT agent | Queue work, respond, assign, link assets |
| Senior agent | Escalations, KB/asset write, problems |
| IT manager | Oversight, reports, org, MI |
| Approver | Decide multi-step approvals (incl. CAB) |
| Administrator (`sysadmin`) | Full configuration |
| Auditor | Read-oriented audit / reports / history |

There is **no separate admin app** — elevation is role-based inside the same UI.

### Seeded roles

| Code | Display | Typical access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `employee` | Employee | Own tickets, KB read, catalog |
| `agent` | IT Support Agent | Queue, assign, internal notes, assets read |
| `senior_agent` | Senior IT Agent | Agent + stronger KB/asset write |
| `it_manager` | IT Manager | Broad tickets, **IMS**, reports, audit, org |
| `approver` | Approver | Approvals queue |
| `sysadmin` | Administrator | All permissions |
| `auditor` | Auditor | Audit/reports/read style |

### Permission model

- One **primary role** per user.
- Optional **extra permissions** (additive only).
- Effective permissions = role ∪ extras.
- **UI hiding is not security** — API guards enforce every action.

Key codes (from `@logit/shared`):

`users:read|write|manage` · `roles:manage` · `tickets:read_own|read_queue|read_all|write|assign|internal_note` · `org:read|manage` · `audit:read` · `reports:read` · `settings:manage` · `knowledge:read|write` · `assets:read|write` · `approvals:read|decide|manage` · **`im:read|write|command|postmortem`**

IMS permissions are seeded on **`it_manager`** and **`sysadmin`**. Grant `im:*` extras to agents who join command roles.

### Demo accounts (development only)

After `npm run db:seed` — passwords are `LogIt-<Role>-2026!` style:

| Email | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `admin@logit.local` | sysadmin / Administrator |
| `employee@logit.local` | employee |
| `agent@logit.local` | agent |
| `senior@logit.local` | senior_agent |
| `manager@logit.local` | it_manager |
| `approver@logit.local` | approver |
| `auditor@logit.local` | auditor |

Default admin password (seed): `LogIt-Admin-2026!` — **dev only; rotate in any shared environment.**

## 4. Architecture at a glance

```
Browser / Slack / Teams / Email
        │
        ▼
   Nginx (prod TLS)
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   ▼         ▼
 Web       API (/api/v1)
(Next.js)   (NestJS)
             │
     ┌───────┼────────┐
     ▼       ▼        ▼
 Postgres  Redis   Uploads volume
             │
          Worker (SLA ticks)
             │
   In-process pollers: IMAP, digests, report/audit schedules
```

**Modular monolith:** clear Nest modules, one deployable API. PostgreSQL is source of truth; Redis is cache/presence/queues, not the system of record.

Local ports: Web **3100**, API **4100**, Nginx compose **8180**, Postgres host **15432**, Redis **6379**.

## 5. Navigation tour

Nav is **permission-filtered** (`apps/web/src/lib/access.ts`).

### Always (signed-in)

| Nav | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | `/app` | Role-aware shortcuts |
| Tickets / My tickets / My assignments | `/app/tickets` | List + create |
| Knowledge | `/app/knowledge` | Articles |
| Catalog | `/app/catalog` | Service requests |

Also: notification bell → `/app/notifications`; avatar → Profile (`/app/profile`).

### Agent workspace (queue-capable staff)

| Nav | Route | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IM | `/app/im` | Requires `im:read` |
| Major | `/app/major-incidents` | ITSM major-incident ops |
| Problems | `/app/problems` | |
| Changes | `/app/changes` | |

**Queue** (`/app/queue`) is **not** in the top nav. Agents open it from **Home** (Queue board / KPI title cards). That keeps room for IM, Major, Problems, and Changes.

### Role tools

| Nav | Permission |
| --- | --- |
| Approvals | `approvals:read` |
| Assets | `assets:read` |
| Reports | `reports:read` |
| Audit | `audit:read` |

### Admin tools

| Nav | Typical gate |
| --- | --- |
| Users | `users:manage` |
| Roles & Access | `roles:manage` / `users:manage` |
| Teams / Departments / Locations | `org:manage` |
| Routing & SLA | `settings:manage` / `org:manage` |
| Approval policies | `settings:manage` |
| Integrations / Branding | `sysadmin` |
